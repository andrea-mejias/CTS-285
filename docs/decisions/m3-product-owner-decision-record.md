# M3 Product Owner Decision Record

## Scenario
StudyTrack release planning under constrained capacity.

## Round 1 — Capacity 13
- ST-01: Create a study task (3 pts)
- ST-02: Mark a study task complete (2 pts)
- ST-03: Recover a missed task (3 pts)
- ST-04: Keyboard-accessible task entry (2 pts)

**Why this release slice was defensible:**
Most of the features have a high value and are core features for students to utilize. Any other features have low readiness and not much value.

**One intentional deferral and why:**
I deferred the color theme item because it was unnecessary and would shift the main goal of the release to something that would not help them continue to the goal.

## Complication
Capacity dropped from 13 to 10 points. Keyboard accessibility testing revealed that task entry cannot reliably be completed with keyboard navigation, so ST-04 became release-critical.

## Revised Release Slice — Capacity 10
- ST-01: Create a study task (3 pts)
- ST-02: Mark a study task complete (2 pts)
- ST-03: Recover a missed task (3 pts)
- ST-04: Keyboard-accessible task entry (2 pts)

### Removed after complication
- None

### Added after complication
- None

**What changed and why:**
Nothing was changed as what I selected was core requirements.

**Tradeoff accepted:**
I accepted the complication itself as I did not revise much. The accessibility fix is the only feature that must be done before release.

## Transfer to DataMan
Before finalizing your DataMan backlog, review whether any item is high value but not ready, depends on unresolved work, consumes disproportionate effort, or should move because it reduces risk or unlocks other work.
